JAVELIN.AI - DQI MODEL REPORT
============================================================

METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
Approach: Domain-Knowledge Based Scoring
Reason: Signal analysis showed DQ metrics do not predict SAE.
        ML-based weights would be meaningless.
        Domain knowledge provides actionable, interpretable weights.

WEIGHT RATIONALE
----------------------------------------
sae_pending_count: 25%
  Pending SAE reviews are critical safety signals requiring immediate attention

uncoded_meddra_count: 15%
  Uncoded adverse events = untracked safety signals

missing_visit_count: 12%
  Missing visits = missing safety monitoring touchpoints

missing_pages_count: 10%
  Missing CRF pages = incomplete subject record

lab_issues_count: 10%
  Lab issues can mask safety signals in bloodwork

max_days_outstanding: 8%
  Delayed data entry reduces real-time safety visibility

max_days_page_missing: 6%
  Long-missing pages indicate systemic site issues

uncoded_whodd_count: 6%
  Uncoded drug terms affect medication tracking

edrr_open_issues: 5%
  External data reconciliation issues

inactivated_forms_count: 3%
  Inactivated forms indicate data corrections (lower risk)
